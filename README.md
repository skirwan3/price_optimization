# Price Optimization
This served as my final project for Deterministic Optimization (ISyE 6669) at Georgia Tech.

The primary aim of this project is to use the Gurobi optimization package to determine a product's optimal price in order to maximize profit. More specifically, the project explores how a product's elasticity influences this optimal price. Data from retail sales (furniture) were used for the elastic product. Data for natural gas were used for the inelastic product.
